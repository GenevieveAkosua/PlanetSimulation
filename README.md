# PlanetSimultation

This is a basic planet orbit simulation done using pyhton and pygame. It's just a fun little project to get used to using some math, physics, and python tools.

### What you need

All you need is:
1. Python
2. Pygame
3. A bit of physics and math knowledge

on YouTube, whose tutorial I followed to create this. He wonderfully explains everything you need to create this simulation, including the maths and physics.

### Have fun!

Please feel free to take the source code and have fun with it yourself :)
